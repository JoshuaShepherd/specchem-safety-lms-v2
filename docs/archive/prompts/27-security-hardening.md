# Phase 9: Production Readiness - Part 2 (Days 30-31)

## Step 9.2: Security Hardening

**Required Context Files:**
- `apps/crm/src/app/api/` - All API routes for security review
- `apps/crm/src/lib/auth/` - Authentication and authorization
- `apps/crm/src/lib/middleware/` - Security middleware
- `apps/crm/src/lib/db/schema/` - Database schemas and RLS policies
- `apps/crm/drizzle/` - Migration files for security policies
- `next.config.ts` - Next.js security configuration
- `apps/crm/src/lib/monitoring/` - Security monitoring (if exist)
- `apps/crm/src/lib/security/` - Security utilities (if exist)

**Cursor Prompt:**

```
Implement production security measures:

1. Set up proper CORS configuration
2. Implement rate limiting
3. Add security headers
4. Set up monitoring and alerting
5. Create security documentation

Ensure the application is secure and follows security best practices.
```

**Expected Output:**

- CORS configuration and rate limiting
- Security headers and monitoring
- Security documentation and best practices
- Production-ready security measures

**Definition of Done:**

- ✅ Security hardened with proper measures
- ✅ CORS, rate limiting, and security headers configured
- ✅ Monitoring and alerting implemented
