# Check-in: Core Features Integration Test

## End-to-End Feature Validation

**Required Context Files:**
- `apps/crm/src/app/` - All feature pages and layouts
- `apps/crm/src/components/` - All feature components
- `apps/crm/src/app/api/` - All API route implementations
- `packages/contracts/src/index.ts` - All DTO types and schemas
- `apps/crm/src/lib/` - All libraries (queries, mappers, validations, auth)
- `apps/crm/src/lib/db/schema/` - All database schemas
- `tests/integration/` - Integration test files (if exist)
- `tests/e2e/` - End-to-end test files (if exist)

**Cursor Prompt:**

```
Perform comprehensive end-to-end testing of our core Safety Training features to validate the complete user workflow:

1. **Complete User Journey Testing:**
   - Test full user authentication flow (register → verify → login → access)
   - Verify plant assignment and role-based access throughout the application
   - Test plant creation → user addition → course creation → enrollment → progress tracking workflow
   - Check data relationships and dependencies work correctly across entities
   - Validate search and filtering work across all implemented features

2. **Data Flow Validation:**
   - Test that data flows correctly: Frontend → API → Database → Response → UI
   - Verify plant-based data isolation works in practice
   - Check that audit logging captures all user actions correctly
   - Test data consistency during concurrent operations
   - Validate that optimistic updates resolve correctly

3. **Feature Completeness Assessment:**
   - Plant Management: Create, read, update, delete, search, filter
   - User Profile Management: CRUD operations, plant relationships, training activity tracking
   - Course Management: Enrollment progression, completion tracking, plant/user links
   - Training Activity Logging: Timeline views, types, reminders, search
   - Test bulk operations and data import/export functionality

4. **User Experience Validation:**
   - Test application performance with realistic data volumes
   - Verify loading states and error handling provide good user feedback
   - Check responsive design works across desktop, tablet, and mobile
   - Test accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
   - Validate form validation provides clear, helpful error messages

5. **Business Logic Verification:**
   - Test plant-based access control prevents unauthorized data access
   - Verify role permissions work correctly (admin, manager, sales rep)
   - Check business rules are enforced (required fields, data validation)
   - Test that calculated fields and derived data are accurate
   - Validate reporting and analytics show correct data

**Generate a Safety Training core features integration report with:**
- 🎯 User journey completion rates and pain points
- 📊 Feature completeness matrix (implemented vs. planned)
- 🔗 Data flow integrity and consistency results
- 👤 User experience quality assessment
- 🏢 Business logic validation results
- 🚨 Critical bugs or workflow blockers
- ⚠️ Usability issues or performance concerns
- 📋 Recommendations for improving user workflows
- 🚀 Feature readiness score for advanced Safety Training functionality

Include specific test scenarios and examples of fixing common integration issues.
```

**Expected Output:**
- Complete core features integration assessment
- User journey and workflow validation
- Feature completeness and quality evaluation
- Business logic and data integrity verification
- User experience and performance analysis

**When to Use This Check-in:**
- After completing steps 16-19 (core features)
- Before implementing advanced features
- When preparing for user acceptance testing
- After making significant changes to core functionality
