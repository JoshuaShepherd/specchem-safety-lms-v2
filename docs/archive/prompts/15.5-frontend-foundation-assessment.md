# Check-in: Frontend Foundation Assessment

## UI & Component System Health Check

**Required Context Files:**
- `packages/ui/src/components/` - All UI components
- `packages/ui/src/index.ts` - UI package exports
- `apps/crm/src/components/` - App-specific components
- `apps/crm/src/lib/validations/` - Form validation schemas
- `apps/crm/src/lib/stores/` - State management stores
- `apps/crm/src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `apps/crm/src/app/` - App structure and pages
- `apps/crm/src/lib/forms/` - Form utilities

**Cursor Prompt:**

```
Perform a comprehensive assessment of our Safety Training frontend foundation and component system:

1. **Component Library Validation:**
   - Test all shadcn/ui base components are properly installed and themed
   - Verify custom Safety Training components render correctly in isolation
   - Check component TypeScript types and prop validation
   - Test component accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
   - Validate responsive design across different screen sizes
   - Test component error boundaries and loading states

2. **Form System Assessment:**
   - Test react-hook-form + Zod integration works correctly
   - Verify all entity forms (plants, courses, enrollments, progress) validate properly
   - Check real-time validation and error message display
   - Test form auto-save functionality and field dependencies
   - Validate form submission integrates correctly with API contracts
   - Test custom validation rules and business logic

3. **State Management Validation:**
   - Test Zustand stores for authentication, settings, and cache management
   - Verify custom hooks for data fetching and caching work correctly
   - Check optimistic updates and error handling in state
   - Test cache invalidation strategies
   - Validate state persistence and hydration
   - Test state management performance with large datasets

4. **Frontend-Backend Integration:**
   - Test that frontend correctly calls API endpoints with proper types
   - Verify authentication state syncs between frontend and backend
   - Check that plant-based access control works in UI
   - Test error handling when API calls fail
   - Validate loading states and user feedback during API operations
   - Test data freshness and real-time updates

5. **Development Experience:**
   - Verify hot reload works correctly with all packages
   - Test that TypeScript errors are caught in development
   - Check that linting and formatting work across all frontend code
   - Validate import paths and package resolution
   - Test that component development is smooth and productive
