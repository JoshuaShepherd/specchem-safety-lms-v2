# Phase 5: Frontend Foundation - Part 1 (Days 12-15)

## Step 5.1: Create Component Library

**Required Context Files:**
- `packages/ui/src/components/` - Existing UI components
- `packages/ui/src/index.ts` - UI package exports
- `apps/crm/src/components/ui/` - shadcn/ui components
- `packages/contracts/src/index.ts` - DTO types for component props
- `apps/crm/src/lib/validations/` - Form validation schemas
- `apps/crm/src/app/` - App structure and layout files
- `apps/crm/components.json` - shadcn/ui configuration

**Cursor Prompt:**

```
Add Safety Training-specific components to our existing shadcn/ui setup:

1. Extend existing shadcn/ui components for Safety business use:
   - Enhance existing forms with Safety Training validation
   - Build Safety Training data tables with sorting/filtering
   - Create Safety Training-specific modals and dialogs
   - Add Safety Training navigation to existing nav structure
   - Extend existing loading and error states

2. Create Safety Training-specific components:
   - Plant/User profile cards
   - Training pipeline views
   - Training progress timelines
   - Course selectors
   - Plant management
   - Enrollment management components

3. Ensure all components:
   - Use proper TypeScript types
   - Include proper error handling
   - Are accessible and responsive
   - Follow consistent design patterns
   - Support proper form validation
```

**Expected Output:**

- Component library with shadcn/ui base components
- Safety Training-specific components for all entities
- Type-safe, accessible, and responsive components
- Consistent design patterns throughout

**Definition of Done:**

- ✅ Component library with shadcn/ui base components
- ✅ Safety Training-specific components for all entities
- ✅ All components are type-safe and accessible
- ✅ Consistent design patterns throughout
