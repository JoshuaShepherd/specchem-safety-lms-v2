# Check-in: Foundation Health Check

## Quick Status Assessment

**Cursor Prompt:**

```
Perform a comprehensive health check of our monorepo foundation setup:

1. **Monorepo Structure Validation:**
   - Verify all packages (@platform/contracts, @platform/db, @platform/mappers, @platform/auth, @platform/server-kit, @platform/testing) exist with proper structure
   - Check that each package has proper exports, types, and build configuration
   - Validate workspace dependencies are correctly linked
   - Ensure turbo.json pipeline is working (run `pnpm build` and verify all packages build)

2. **Next.js App Assessment:**
   - Verify Next.js 15.x (LTS) is installed and working
   - Check basic routing and pages are functional
   - Test Supabase connection and environment variables
   - Validate Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components are accessible

3. **TypeScript Configuration Review:**
   - Run `pnpm type-check` across all packages
   - Verify no TypeScript errors in staged strictness mode
   - Check that path mapping works for imports
   - Ensure shared tsconfig is being used correctly

4. **Development Environment Test:**
   - Start development server and verify it loads without errors
   - Test hot reload functionality
   - Check that all workspace packages can import from each other
   - Verify environment variables are loading correctly

5. **Build System Verification:**
   - Run full build pipeline: `pnpm build && pnpm type-check && pnpm lint`
   - Check that all packages build to dist/ correctly
   - Verify turbo caching is working
   - Ensure no build errors or warnings

**Generate a health report with:**
- ‚úÖ Working components (green)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues that need attention (yellow)
- ‚ùå Blocking problems (red)
- üìã Recommended next steps
- üîß Quick fixes for common issues

If any issues are found, provide specific commands to resolve them.
```

**Expected Output:**
- Complete health assessment of foundation
- Clear status indicators for each component
- Specific fix recommendations for any issues
- Confidence level for proceeding to database phase

**When to Use This Check-in:**
- After completing steps 01-03 (foundation setup)
- If you're experiencing build or dependency issues
- Before moving to database migration phase
- When onboarding new team members

**Next Phase:** If all green ‚úÖ, proceed to `04-drizzle-setup.md`
**If Issues:** Address problems before continuing to database phase
