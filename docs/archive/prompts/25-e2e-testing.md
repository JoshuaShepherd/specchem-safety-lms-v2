# Phase 8: Testing and Quality Assurance - Part 3 (Days 27-29)

## Step 8.3: End-to-End Testing

**Required Context Files:**
- `apps/crm/src/app/` - Complete application structure for E2E testing
- `apps/crm/src/components/` - All components for user interaction testing
- `apps/crm/src/app/api/` - API routes for backend testing
- `packages/contracts/src/index.ts` - DTO types for test data
- `playwright.config.ts` - Playwright configuration (if exists)
- `tests/e2e/` - E2E test directory (if exists)
- `tests/fixtures/` - Test data fixtures
- `apps/crm/package.json` - Dependencies (playwright)

**Cursor Prompt:**

```
Set up end-to-end testing with Playwright:

1. Add Playwright E2E testing to existing app for Safety Training workflows
2. Create Safety Training test scenarios for:
   - User authentication (test existing + Safety business integration)
   - Plant management workflows
   - User profile management
   - Course management pipeline
   - Training activity logging

3. Set up CI/CD testing pipeline
4. Create test data management
5. Implement test reporting

Ensure critical user workflows are tested end-to-end.
```

**Expected Output:**

- Playwright E2E testing configuration
- Test scenarios for critical workflows
- CI/CD testing pipeline
- Test data management and reporting

**Definition of Done:**

- ✅ End-to-end testing for critical workflows
- ✅ CI/CD testing pipeline configured
- ✅ Test data management and fixtures
- ✅ All tests pass consistently
