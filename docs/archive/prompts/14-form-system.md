# Phase 5: Frontend Foundation - Part 2 (Days 12-15)

## Step 5.2: Build Form System

**Required Context Files:**
- `packages/contracts/src/index.ts` - DTO schemas for form validation
- `apps/crm/src/lib/validations/` - Zod validation schemas
- `packages/ui/src/components/` - Form UI components
- `apps/crm/src/components/ui/` - shadcn/ui form components
- `apps/crm/src/lib/forms/` - Form utilities (if exists)
- `apps/crm/src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks (if exists)
- `apps/crm/package.json` - Dependencies (react-hook-form, zod)

**Cursor Prompt:**

```
Add Safety Training forms to our existing react-hook-form + Zod setup:

1. Build form components using react-hook-form and Zod:
   - Plant creation/editing forms
   - User profile management forms
   - Course creation/editing forms
   - Enrollment management forms
   - Progress tracking forms
   - Activity logging forms

2. Implement proper form features:
   - Real-time validation
   - Error handling and display
   - Auto-save functionality
   - Field dependencies
   - Custom validation rules

3. Create form utilities for:
   - Data transformation
   - Validation handling
   - Error message display
   - Form state management

4. Ensure all forms are type-safe and use proper validation schemas
```

**Expected Output:**

- Comprehensive form system with react-hook-form + Zod
- Real-time validation and error handling
- Form utilities for data transformation
- Type-safe forms with proper validation

**Definition of Done:**

- ✅ Comprehensive form system with react-hook-form + Zod
- ✅ All forms use proper validation and error handling
- ✅ Form utilities implemented for consistency
