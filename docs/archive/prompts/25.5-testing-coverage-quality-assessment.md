# Check-in: Testing Coverage & Quality Assessment

## Testing Infrastructure Validation

**Required Context Files:**
- `tests/unit/` - All unit test files
- `tests/integration/` - All integration test files
- `tests/e2e/` - All end-to-end test files
- `vitest.config.ts` - Vitest configuration
- `playwright.config.ts` - Playwright configuration
- `apps/crm/package.json` - Test scripts and dependencies
- `coverage/` - Test coverage reports (if exist)
- `apps/crm/src/` - All source code for coverage analysis
- `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD pipeline configurations (if exist)

**Cursor Prompt:**

```
Perform a comprehensive assessment of our Safety Training testing infrastructure, coverage, and quality:

1. **Test Coverage Analysis:**
   - Generate test coverage reports for all packages and applications
   - Verify unit test coverage is >80% for critical business logic
   - Check integration test coverage for all API endpoints
   - Validate E2E test coverage for critical user workflows
   - Identify untested code paths and critical functionality gaps

2. **Test Quality & Reliability:**
   - Run all test suites and verify consistent pass rates (>95%)
   - Check test execution time and identify slow or flaky tests
   - Verify tests properly isolate functionality and don't depend on external state
   - Test that mocks and fixtures accurately represent real data scenarios
   - Validate test error messages are clear and helpful for debugging

3. **Testing Infrastructure Assessment:**
   - Test that CI/CD pipeline runs all tests correctly
   - Verify test databases and fixtures are properly managed
   - Check that test environments match production configurations
   - Test parallel test execution and resource management
   - Validate test reporting and failure notification systems

4. **Test Automation & Maintenance:**
   - Verify tests run automatically on code changes
   - Check that broken tests prevent deployment
   - Test that test data management is automated and consistent
   - Validate test maintenance burden is reasonable
   - Check that tests serve as living documentation

5. **Production Readiness Testing:**
   - Run load testing to validate performance under expected usage
   - Test disaster recovery and backup/restore procedures
   - Verify monitoring and alerting systems work correctly
   - Test deployment procedures and rollback capabilities
   - Validate production configuration and environment setup

**Generate a Safety Training testing quality assessment report with:**
- 📊 Test coverage metrics by package and functionality
- 🎯 Test reliability and execution performance
- 🏗️ Testing infrastructure health and CI/CD integration
- 🔄 Test automation and maintenance assessment
- 🚀 Production readiness validation results
- 🚨 Critical testing gaps that must be addressed
- ⚠️ Test reliability or performance issues
- 📋 Recommendations for improving test quality and coverage
- 🛡️ Risk assessment for production deployment
- ✅ Testing sign-off checklist for production deployment

Include specific commands for running tests and fixing common testing issues.
```

**Expected Output:**
- Complete testing coverage and quality assessment
- Test infrastructure and CI/CD validation
- Production readiness testing results
- Risk assessment for deployment
- Testing improvement recommendations

**When to Use This Check-in:**
- After completing steps 23-25 (testing implementation)
- Before production deployment preparation
- When investigating test failures or coverage gaps
- During quality assurance and stakeholder reviews
