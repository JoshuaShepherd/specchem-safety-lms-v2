## Integration Points

### Safety Training Integration
1. **User Profiles**: Connect to existing profiles table for user management
2. **Plant Management**: Use existing plants table for multi-tenant organization
3. **Activity Logging**: Leverage existing activity_events for training tracking
4. **Admin Roles**: Use existing role system for training permissions
5. **Audit Trail**: Leverage existing audit system for compliance tracking

### Data Flow
```
User Authentication → Profile Lookup → Role Assignment → Training Access
     ↓
Course Enrollment → Progress Tracking → Activity Logging
     ↓
Audit Trail → Compliance Reporting → Learning Analytics
```

## Success Metrics
- ✅ Safety training system fully functional
- ✅ Modern training interfaces implemented
- ✅ Single sign-on across training modules
- ✅ Comprehensive progress tracking and reporting
- ✅ Maintained security and compliance standards
- ✅ Performance meets enterprise requirements

## Risk Mitigation
1. **Database Integration**: Use existing schema without modifications
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing safety features remain intact
3. **Security**: Maintain RLS policies and audit logging
4. **Performance**: Monitor query performance with new frontend features
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing before production deployment

## Timeline Summary
- **Days 1-2**: Authentication and environment setup
- **Days 3-5**: API development and data access layer
