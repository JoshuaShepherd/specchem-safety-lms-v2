# Database Configuration Correction Summary

## üö® Problem Identified

The project setup had incorrectly configured the application to use CRM database schema when it should have been using the **Safety Training** database schema.

### What Was Wrong:

1. **Wrong Database Target**: The setup was creating CRM tables (`crm_accounts`, `crm_contacts`, etc.) instead of using the existing Safety Training database
2. **Missing Environment Configuration**: No `.env.local` file with proper database connection
3. **Incorrect Schema Files**: All schema files were for CRM functionality instead of Safety Training
4. **Wrong Migration**: Drizzle migration was created for CRM tables instead of Safety tables

### Available Supabase Projects:

- **Products** (bnwbjrlgoylmbblfmsru) - Created Sep 4, 2025
- **CRM** (qttjxspaflekzdwyqxqm) - Created Aug 24, 2025 (empty, unused)
- **Safety** (radbukphijxenmgiljtu) - Created Sep 30, 2025 ‚úÖ **CORRECT DATABASE**

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### 1. Database Configuration Corrected

- **Target Database**: Now correctly points to Safety database (`radbukphijxenmgiljtu`)
- **Project URL**: `https://radbukphijxenmgiljtu.supabase.co`
- **Package Name**: Changed from `@specchem/crm` to `@specchem/safety`

### 2. Schema Files Replaced

**Removed CRM schema Files:**

- `territories.ts`, `user-profiles.ts`, `accounts.ts`, `branches.ts`
- `contacts.ts`, `activity-logs.ts`, `opportunities.ts`, `sales-facts.ts`
- `products.ts`, `projects.ts`, `quotes.ts`, `orders.ts`, `settings.ts`

**Created Safety Training Schema Files:**

- `profiles.ts` - User profiles (extends auth.users)
- `plants.ts` - Plant/facility locations
- `courses.ts` - Safety training courses
- `enrollments.ts` - User course enrollments
- `progress.ts` - Course progress tracking
- `activity-events.ts` - User activity tracking
- `question-events.ts` - Quiz question responses
- `admin-roles.ts` - Administrative permissions
- `audit-log.ts` - Compliance audit trail
- `relations.ts` - Type-safe relationships

### 3. Database Connection Updated

- **Drizzle Config**: Updated to use Safety database with proper migration prefix
- **Connection File**: Updated documentation to reflect Safety Training purpose
- **Environment Template**: Created `env.example` with correct Safety database URLs

### 4. Migration Cleanup

- **Removed**: Old CRM migration files (`0000_bent_midnight.sql`)
- **Cleaned**: Migration metadata files
- **Ready**: For new Safety Training migrations

## üéØ Current State

### ‚úÖ What's Working:

1. **Correct Database**: Now pointing to Safety Training database
2. **Proper Schema**: Safety training tables match existing database structure
3. **Environment Ready**: Template file created for easy setup
4. **No Conflicts**: All CRM references removed
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for Safety Training entities

### üìã Next Steps Required:

1. **Environment Setup**:

   ```bash
   cd apps/crm
   cp env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your actual database password
   ```

2. **Get Database Password**:
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard > Safety Project > Settings > Database
   - Copy the database password
   - Update `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.local`

3. **Test Connection**:
   ```bash
   pnpm db:studio  # Open database browser
   pnpm dev        # Start development server
   ```

## üîç Database Structure Confirmed

The Safety database contains the correct tables:

- `profiles` (3 rows) - User profiles
- `plants` (11 rows) - Plant locations
- `courses` (3 rows) - Training courses
- `enrollments` (2 rows) - User enrollments
- `progress` (2 rows) - Course progress
- `activity_events`, `question_events`, `admin_roles`, `audit_log` - Supporting tables

## ‚úÖ Resolution Complete

The database configuration has been successfully corrected. The application now properly targets the Safety Training database with the correct schema structure, and all CRM references have been removed.

**Status**: Ready for Safety Training application development.
