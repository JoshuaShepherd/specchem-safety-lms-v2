# Section Navigation Issue - RESOLVED ✅

## 🔍 Problem Identified

**User Issue:** "I can't click through the sections"

**Root Cause:** The course learning interface implements a **sequential progression model** where:
1. ✅ **Section 1** is always accessible
2. ❌ **Sections 2-9** are locked until the previous section is completed
3. ❌ Users weren't aware they needed to click "Mark Complete" to unlock next sections

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### **1. Added Demo Mode Toggle**
- **Location:** Left sidebar in the learning interface
- **Feature:** Switch to unlock all sections for testing purposes
- **Benefit:** Allows immediate access to all course content for demos/testing
