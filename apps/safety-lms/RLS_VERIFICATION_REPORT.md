  - Users can only access data from their assigned territory
  - Cross-territory access blocked for non-admin users
  - Admin override capabilities for legitimate business needs

- **User role-based permissions**: ✅ Comprehensive implementation
  - `safety_admin`: Full access to all territories and data
  - `safety_manager`: Territory-wide management capabilities
  - `safety_coordinator`: Territory-wide coordination and projects
  - `safety_instructor`: Training-focused access
  - `safety_rep`: Territory-wide sales and customer management
  - `plant_manager`: Plant-specific access
  - `hr_admin`: HR-focused access
  - `employee`: Limited access to own records and territory data

- **Data isolation between territories**: ✅ Enforced at database level
  - Territory boundaries enforced through RLS policies
  - No cross-territory data leakage possible
  - Proper indexing for performance optimization

- **Owner-based access**: ✅ Implemented across all tables
  - Users can access records they own regardless of territory
  - Ownership tracked via `owner_id` and `created_by` fields
  - Admin and manager override for legitimate business needs

### ✅ 3. Implement Policy Patterns for Safety Business Tables

**Status: COMPLETE**

**Safety Business Tables with RLS Policies:**

- ✅ `territories` - Territory visibility, admin management
- ✅ `user_profiles` - Own profile access, territory-based viewing
- ✅ `accounts` - Territory access, role-based management
- ✅ `branches` - Account-based access control
- ✅ `contacts` - Account-based access, owner-based access
- ✅ `activity_logs` - User-based access, territory-based viewing
- ✅ `opportunities` - Territory access, role-based management
- ✅ `sales_facts` - Territory access, user-based access
- ✅ `products` - Territory access, role-based management
- ✅ `projects` - Territory access, role-based management

**Policy Patterns Implemented:**

- ✅ **SELECT policies**: Users can read data from their territory + owned records
- ✅ **INSERT policies**: Users can create records in their territory based on role
- ✅ **UPDATE policies**: Users can update owned records + territory records based on role
- ✅ **DELETE policies**: Safety admin/manager roles only, with territory restrictions

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Helper Functions Created

**Territory Functions:**

```sql
get_user_territory_id()                    -- Get current user's territory
get_user_territory_id_by_user(user_id)     -- Get specific user's territory
can_access_territory(user_id, territory_id) -- Check territory access
```

**Role Functions:**

```sql
has_safety_role(user_id, role)             -- Check specific Safety role
is_safety_admin_or_manager(user_id)        -- Check admin/manager status
owns_record_or_is_admin(user_id, owner_id) -- Check ownership or admin
```

### RLS Policies Applied

**All Safety Business Tables Protected:**

- Territory-based access control
- Role-based permissions
- Owner-based access patterns
