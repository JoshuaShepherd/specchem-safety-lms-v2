## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Safety Business Tables with RLS

- **territories** - Regional foundation (territory visibility, admin management)
- **user_profiles** - Extended user profiles (own access, territory-based viewing)
- **accounts** - Safety equipment customers (territory access, role-based management)
- **branches** - Physical locations (account-based access control)
- **contacts** - Individual people (account-based access, owner-based access)
- **activity_logs** - Safety activities (user-based access, territory-based viewing)
- **opportunities** - Sales pipeline (territory access, role-based management)
- **sales_facts** - Historical data (territory access, user-based access)
- **products** - Equipment catalog (territory access, role-based management)
- **projects** - Construction projects (territory access, role-based management)

### Preserved Systems (Untouched)

- ✅ **Supabase auth.users, auth.sessions** - No modifications
- ✅ **Safety training tables** - All existing policies preserved
- ✅ **Existing helper functions** - Compatible with new RLS system

## 🔐 Security Model

### Territory-Based Access Control

```
Territory A (North)          Territory B (South)          Territory C (East)
├── Admin (Full Access)      ├── Admin (Full Access)      ├── Admin (Full Access)
├── Manager (Territory)      ├── Manager (Territory)      ├── Manager (Territory)
├── Rep (Territory)          ├── Rep (Territory)          ├── Rep (Territory)
└── Employee (Limited)       └── Employee (Limited)       └── Employee (Limited)
```

### Role Hierarchy

1. **safety_admin** - Full access to all territories and data
2. **safety_manager** - Territory-wide management capabilities
3. **safety_coordinator** - Territory-wide coordination and projects
4. **safety_rep** - Territory-wide sales and customer management
5. **safety_instructor** - Training-focused access
6. **plant_manager** - Plant-specific access
7. **hr_admin** - HR-focused access
8. **employee** - Limited access to own records and territory data

### Access Patterns

- **Territory Isolation**: Users can only access data within their assigned territory
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Different roles have different CRUD capabilities
- **Owner-Based Access**: Users can always access records they own
- **Admin Override**: Safety admins can access all data across territories

## 🧪 Testing Framework

### SQL Test Functions

- `setup_test_territories()` - Create test territories
- `setup_test_users()` - Create test users with different roles
- `setup_test_accounts()` - Create test accounts
- `run_all_rls_tests()` - Execute comprehensive test suite
- `cleanup_test_data()` - Clean up test data

### Test Categories

1. **Territory Isolation** - Verify cross-territory access prevention
2. **Role-Based Access** - Verify role permission enforcement
3. **Owner-Based Access** - Verify record ownership rules
4. **Cross-Territory Prevention** - Verify territory boundaries
5. **Admin Override** - Verify admin capabilities

### TypeScript Integration Tests

- Vitest-based test suite
- Drizzle ORM integration verification
- Real-world query scenarios
- Automated test execution

## 🔧 Helper Functions

### Territory Functions

```sql
get_user_territory_id()                    -- Get current user's territory
get_user_territory_id_by_user(user_id)     -- Get specific user's territory
can_access_territory(user_id, territory_id) -- Check territory access
```

### Role Functions

```sql
has_safety_role(user_id, role)             -- Check specific Safety role
is_safety_admin_or_manager(user_id)        -- Check admin/manager status
owns_record_or_is_admin(user_id, owner_id) -- Check ownership or admin
```

## 📊 Access Control Matrix

| Operation  | safety_admin | safety_manager   | safety_coordinator   | safety_rep                        | employee        |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **SELECT** | All data     | Territory data   | Territory data       | Territory data                    | Own + territory |
| **INSERT** | All tables   | Territory tables | Projects, activities | Accounts, contacts, opportunities | Activities only |
| **UPDATE** | All data     | Territory data   | Own + territory      | Own + territory                   | Own data only   |
| **DELETE** | All data     | Territory data   | Own data only        | Own data only                     | Own data only   |
