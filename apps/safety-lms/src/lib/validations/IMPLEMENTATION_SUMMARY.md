## 🎯 Key Integration Patterns Implemented

### 1. Auth + Training + Business Integration

**Multi-System User Context:**

```typescript
enhancedAuthUserSchema = {
  // Auth fields
  id, email, firstName, lastName, role,

  // Multi-system access
  systems: ["training", "business"],

  // Training context
  plantId, plant, trainingProfile,

  // Business context
  territoryId, territory,

  // Comprehensive permissions
  permissions: {
    training: { canManageAllPlants, canManageUsers, ... },
    business: { canManageAllTerritories, canManageAllAccounts, ... },
    crossSystem: { canAccessBothSystems, ... }
  }
}
```

### 2. Territory and Role-Based Validation

**Territory Access Validation:**

```typescript
territoryValidation.validateTerritoryAccess(
  userTerritoryId,
  targetTerritoryId,
  userRole
);
```

**Role Permission Validation:**

```typescript
roleValidation.validateRolePermission(
  userRole,
  operation: "read" | "write" | "admin",
  resource: string,
  system: "training" | "business" | "both"
)
```

### 3. Cross-System Activity Logging

**Enhanced Activity Log Schema:**

```typescript
enhancedActivityLogSchema = {
  system: "training" | "business" | "both",
  entityType: "account" | "contact" | "opportunity" | "plant" | "user" | ...,
  type: "account_created" | "training_completed" | "integration_event" | ...,
  metadata: {
    trainingData: { courseId, plantId, enrollmentId, score, ... },
    businessData: { opportunityId, territoryId, amount, stage, ... },
    ipAddress, userAgent, location
  }
}
```

### 4. Enhanced API Response Patterns

**Unified Success Response:**

```typescript
enhancedUnifiedSuccessResponseSchema = {
  success: true,
  data: T,
  context: {
    user: enhancedAuthUser,
    system: "training" | "business" | "both",
    territory?: enhancedTerritory,
    plant?: enhancedPlant,
    request: { id, timestamp, duration, source }
  },
  pagination?: enhancedPagination,
  message?: string,
  warnings?: ValidationWarning[],
  timestamp: ISOString
}
```

**Unified Error Response:**

```typescript
enhancedUnifiedErrorResponseSchema = {
  success: false,
  error: {
    code: ValidationErrorCode,
    message: string,
    details?: ValidationErrorDetail[],
    context?: ErrorContext,
    tracking?: ErrorTracking
  },
  metadata?: ErrorMetadata,
  timestamp: ISOString
}
```

## 🔧 Business Rule Validation

### Safety Business Rules

**Opportunity Stage Transition Rules:**

- Validates proper stage transitions (prospecting → qualification → needs_analysis → proposal → negotiation → closed_won/lost)
- Prevents invalid stage transitions
- Tracks stage history with duration metrics

**Contact Role Validation:**

- Validates contact roles against business requirements
- Ensures proper role assignments for safety operations

**Account Type Validation:**

- Validates account types for safety equipment customers
